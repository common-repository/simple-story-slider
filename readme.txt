== Description ==

After stories that scroll, let's slide with Simple Story Slider, the little bro of Simple Long Form.

The plugin activation creates a custom post type (CPT) : "Story Slider" with all of the functionalities of a simple post (RSS feed, category, search...)
Stories can also be listed in a dedicated widget.

IMPORTANT! Please note that this is the last release of the plugin, it is no longer maintained and will no longer be updated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There is a problem for displaying section in the back-end... =

Don't panic : verify the screen options (button on the right at the top of the edit page) and make sure that the chek-box of each section is activated.

= I have made an update of WP and my posts are not showing anymore... =

Go to settings/permalinks and save the settings without making any change (if you don't want to).

= I want to preview my story slider but the page is not found... =

That means that the "flush" function has failed on your installation. Go to "options / permalinks" and save your settings to fix it (you don't have to change the structure of your permalinks).

= I want to preview my story slider but it is not well displaying... =

It might be due to the fact that you have add only one slide. 
This issue will be solved with adding a new slide. Now, it is looking great!

= Where can I find documentation ? =
